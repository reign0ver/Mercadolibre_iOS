### Architecture

First of all and I think, one of the most important parts of an app is the Architectural Pattern we decide to use, 
so that's why I'm gonna start explaining the architecture I used and why I decided to use it, based on its pros.

#### Clean Architecture

Most of you are maybe wondering, *what the hell is Clean Architecture*? Ok, let's start with it.

Clean architecture can be used in any application and platform, not just iOS or Android, so itâ€™s very cool to understand the idea behind it.
If you want to learn more about it, I recommend you to read to ***Robert C. Martin***, also known as ***Uncle Bob***, 
who has written a book about how to write your applications in a *Clean Way*.

You've maybe seen this circle, or any other similar, the number of layers isn't really matter, but what I wanted to show you with this circle is:

Each circle represent different levels of software in your app, so what levels are for? Okay..

- The **center circle** is the most ***abstract***, and the **outer circle** is the most ***concrete***. 
This is called the ***Abstraction Principle*** 

- Each circle can depend only on the nearest inward circle. ***Dependency Rule***

As a brief conclusion about we said before and in a easier language to understand, when we talk about ***abstract*** layers, we're talking about ***protocols***.
Why? Easy, protocols define behavior rather than implementation, so they're really abstract. By the other hand when we talk about ***concrete*** layers, 
we're talking about ***classes*** that implement those ***protocols*** or contracts that already define the behavior that the classes have to conform.

Knowing this, let's see the layers of the architecture I used and what is inside one of them:

- **Presentation:** A layer that interacts with the UI (*I used MVP here*).
- **Interactors (UseCases):** Defines actions the user can trigger (*i.e. when a user searchs something searchProductInteractor*).
- **Domain:** Contains the business logic (*models*) of the app and the abstract definition of all the data sources (*Data protocols).
- **Data:** Concrete implementations of all the data sources defined in the Domain layer.
- **Framework:** Implements frameworks as DI frameworks, UI frameworks, Networking frameworks, etc.

The basic flow the app follows is:

View -> Presenter -> Interactor -> Repository -> DataSource

and with this, we can see the ***dependency rule*** is working as the foundation of Clean Architecture says!
